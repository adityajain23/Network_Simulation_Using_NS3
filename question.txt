4. what are NetDevices,Internet Stack, Csma, Yanswifichannel, Interface exactly?
18. Working of a Csma channel?
7. What is network interface card?
11. How to set up wifi class? Why do we need to set ssid?
15. Populating Routing Tables? Which algo?
16. NetAnim?

Jay:
1. Where is NS3 is used in defense/software companies?
3. Broker connections?
8. Mobile gets disconnected from wifi and connects again?
9. Mobile has it's own mobile data? Can we simulate that?
14. Addresses, netmask, etc?
16. NetAnim?
19. Difference between Csma and Wifi?

Gunjan:
1. Who maintains NS3?
-> NS-3 is maintained by a worldwide team of volunteer maintainers.

8. Mobile gets disconnected from wifi and connects again?
->

9. Mobile has it's own mobile data? Can we simulate that?
-> Here the mobile phone will first be connected to the cell tower and the connection is wireless. It is pretty similar to being connecte to a wifi router.

13. What is mobility model?
-> The mobility model helps us in tracking and maintaining the current position of an object/node. We use mobility helper classes to use the mobility system. NS-3 uses the Cartesian coordinate system.

17. Explain tracing? pcap files?
-> The whole idea of running a  simulation is generating output which we can study and do research on. So tracing is the system that helps us in getting that output/info. Ns3 device helpers are used to create trace files. These files give us some interesting info like when a packet was received by a device/node and give some access to packet contents. 
The trace files are created in pcap file format. The acronym pcap stands for packet capture.

21. Tracing with wireshark/tcpdump?
->  We can view the trace files in two ways-using wireshark or tcpdump. Tcpdump is a command line utility that helps us in capturing and analyzing network traffic. We can also view and analyze the pcap files using wireshark.
